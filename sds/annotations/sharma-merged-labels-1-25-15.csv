cases, the choice of potential therapies

of prevention and better utilization of antimicrobial therapy, notably shortening
the duration and decreasing the number of antibiotics given to ICU patients
to contain the emergence and dissemination of such pathogens.3,9-12 Because of
its frequency and severity,13,14 nosocomial pneumonia in patients requiring
prolonged mechanical ventilation represents 1 of the principal reasons for the

Practice implications
* Regular assessment of the functional abilities
of elderly people living at home has been claimed
to improve health and reduce the use of
institutional care
* This study shows no convincing evidence for
this assumption for the general population of

elderly people
* Regular assessment seems to be effective,
however, when restricted to those elderly people
with poor health

experiments in which the general population was
screened by a public health nurse or general practitioner and followed up by a primary care team also
reported hardly any positive effects.",08343668, PARTICIPANTS,Geographic region: Netherlands All people living at home in a geographically defined area were sent a postal invitation Age: 75 to 84 Exclusion criteria: people already receiving home nursing care or their partners (126); people living in a monastery (20) N = 580,"GENERAL PRACTICE

among patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease, for example, is maximal when the hematocrit is
40 to 45 percent.2
Cardiac disease is the most common cause of death
among patients who are regularly receiving dialysis.3
Among these patients, partial correction of anemia
reduces exercise-induced cardiac ischemia4,5 and ameliorates the left ventricular hypertrophy 4,6-9 that predisposes patients to death and cardiac-related morbidity.10-12 In two pilot studies of patients who were
receiving hemodialysis who maintained a normal hematocrit value13 (and unpublished data), there were no
increases in blood pressure, thrombosis of the vascular access site, seizures, or cardiovascular events, and
normal hematocrit values were associated with an
improved quality of life, shorter hospitalizations, and

studies, the mortality rate among patients with hematocrits below 30 percent was higher than that
among patients with hematocrits of 30 to 35 percent,
and the risk for the smaller number of patients with
hematocrits above 35 percent was not significantly
different from the risk associated with hematocrits of
30 to 35 percent.26,27 Earlier studies also suggested
that up to 35 percent of patients had increases in
blood pressure after the partial correction of anemia,18 whereas the risk of thrombosis of vascular access sites has remained controversial.18,28-30 In several
small studies, normalization of hematocrit was associated with improvements in cognitive function,31 quality of life,13 exercise capacity,13,32 and sleep.33 Thus,

Modified Constraint-Induced Therapy
in Chronic Stroke: Results of a SingleBlinded Randomized Controlled Trial

Background and Purpose

therapy sessions occurring 3 days per week in which subjects used the more affected
arm combined with less affected arm restriction 5 days per week for 5 hours; both
of these regimens were administered during a 10-week period) with that of a
time-matched exercise program for the more affected arm or a no-treatment control
